# 1. Machine Learning - Introduction
### What is Machine Learning (ML)?

Machine Learning (ML) is the science of getting machine to act without being explicitly programmed.

Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to learn from the data and become more accurate in predicting outcomes without human intervention.

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) which focuses mainly on machine learning from their experience and making predictions based on its experience.

Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) which provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

### What does it do? 

It enables the computers or the machines to make data-driven decisions rather than being explicitly programmed for carrying out a certain task. These programs or algorithms are designed in a way that they learn and improve over time when are exposed to new data.

### How does Machine Learning Work?

Machine Learning algorithm is trained using a training data set to create a model. When new input data is introduced to the ML algorithm, it makes a prediction on the basis of the model.

The prediction is evaluated for accuracy and if the accuracy is acceptable, the Machine Learning algorithm is deployed. If the accuracy is not acceptable, the Machine Learning algorithm is trained again and again with an augmented training data set.

### Types of Machine Learning
